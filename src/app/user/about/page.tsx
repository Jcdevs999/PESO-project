            ORIGINS AND ESTABLISHMENT
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs mt-4">
            The QC PESO was established in response to the increased demand for employment services 
            following the late twentieth century's urbanisation and economic changes. As Quezon City
            grew into a commercial and educational powerhouse, the city saw an increase in employment
            searchers, particularly among young graduates and marginalised populations. Recognising
            this difficulty, local government authorities wanted to establish a dedicated office to
            assist with job matching, skill training, and employment support.
            The office was founded in the early 2000s with the goal of providing free services 
            that would connect job searchers with potential employers. This program was part of
            a larger campaign to boost the city's economy and eliminate unemployment.

            TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND INNOVATION
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs mt-4">
            As technology improved, QC PESO tailored its services to meet the evolving needs
            of job searchers and businesses. The development of online job portals and 
            digital platforms transformed the way jobs were matched. The office used technology
            to streamline operations, making it easier for employees to find job openings and 
            apply for them. Additionally, QC PESO began employing data-driven tactics to analyse
            labour market trends, which guided their training programs and assisted local 
            businesses in identifying the skills they required in their workforce.

            DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs mt-4">
            Since its beginnings, QC PESO has focused on delivering a diverse range of services
            to improve employability. These featured employment fairs, skill-building programs,
            and career counselling. The office also formed agreements with other educational
            institutions and private businesses to build a strong network of job prospects.
            Over time, QC PESO has expanded its offerings to include specialised programs for
            marginalised groups such as women, people with impairments, and out-of-school kids.
            This commitment to inclusivity contributed to the empowerment of various communities
            and the removal of systemic job barriers.

            RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs mt-4">
            In recent years, QC PESO has been recognised for its successful programs and initiatives.
            The office has successfully organised multiple job fairs that have united thousands of
            job seekers with employers, resulting in a considerable boost to the local economy.
            It has also won recognition for its efforts to promote equitable employment practices. 
            However, the office has encountered difficulties, particularly during economic 
            downturns and the COVID-19 epidemic, which disrupted labour markets and increased 
            unemployment. In response, QC PESO immediately changed its services to provide virtual
            aid and support to relocated workers, ensuring that help was available even during
            tough circumstances.
